Coastal geology exercise
=====================================================   


.. include:: header.rst

You will be split into two field teams to study some coastal geology. One team is heading to The Bahamas and the other is heading to Hawaii! Your goal is to reconstruct the history of sea-level from your field site. You have a total budget of $3,500 to spend on a consulting geologist with a hand lens ($100 per consultation), and U-series analysis for geochronology ($1,000 per sample).
